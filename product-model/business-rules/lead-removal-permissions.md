# Lead removal permissions

Native Lead operations: active staff access, configured effective model permission, actual queryset and ordered ownership clarification; conversion/import/helper consequences use their initiating checks

Configuration means the actual account evaluated by this handler: its retained direct permissions, assigned Group permissions, Active/Staff/Superuser configuration and derived overlapping role flags. Effective native permissions include Group inheritance and native superuser handling; an unrelated User or Group never supplies authority.

Native CRM object lookup uses the selected department first; otherwise a Superoperator is restricted to assigned department Groups; otherwise the queryset is unfiltered. Ordered clarification accepts Chief, Superoperator or Superuser first; then Operator with matching selected department; then actual owner/co-owner, otherwise refuses. Native Add uses effective Add; native view uses effective View or Change; native change/delete requires its corresponding permission before clarification when an object is supplied.

BaseModelAdmin ID and ticket search branches replace the preceding queryset with the model-wide matching queryset; the ordinary search branch uses the supplied queryset. Do not carry the earlier list filtering into the replacing branches.
