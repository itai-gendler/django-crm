# Create task

## Trigger

Co worker invokes Create task.

## Outcome

A distinct Task is retained with the submitted Name, Description, Note, Priority, due date, stage and responsible people. Start date comes from its retained default. Creation assigns the source-defined account, organizational and date defaults; the saved record is reached through its native save response.
